1. Research!!!
    [X] How to get read command line args? (flag is preferred as it's reading flags)
    [X] How to setup configuration? JSON? YAML? (Currently use JSON as it's encoding is supported natively)
2. MVP
    [X] Make it accept command line args (Done using flag library)
    [X] Read from config file in json
    [X] Ping and ssh to a remote url 
    [X] Test configuration
3. Additional Features
    [X] Implement concurrency
    [] Limit goroutines
4. Testing (SHOCKING!!!)
